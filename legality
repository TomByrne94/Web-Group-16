						<h1>Legality/Laws on DDoS</h1>
						<p>
							Reference Links:<ul>
										<li style="list-style:disc;"><a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1990/18/crossheading/computer-misuse-offences">Computer misuse act 1990</a></li>
										<li  style="list-style:disc;"><a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/48/part/5/crossheading/computer-misuse">2006 update to computer misuse act</a></li>
									</ul>

						<h2 id = "old">Old Law</h2>
						<p>
DDoS attacks and many other cyber crimes were usually ruled under the 1990 legislation which described an offence of doing anything with criminal intent "which causes an unauthorised modification of the contents of any computer". 
						</p>

						<h2 id = "law">DDoS defeats Law</h2>
						<p>
							The problem with this law is that it did not directly conflict with DDoS attacks and was abused in some cases for example the incident in november 2005 where a teenager who sent his previous employer 5 million emails causing the company’s email server to overload had his case dropped. This is because sending the email server a large number of emails could not be considered by the 1990 legislation as “unauthorised modification” which is why soon after the law had been updated to better combat this. 
						</p>

						<h2 id = "new">New Law</h2>
						<p>
							The 1990 legislation act was finally updated in 2006 to better combat DDoS and similar cyber crimes. The new law states that an action is punishable if the person intends by doing so to: to impair the operation of any computer, to prevent or hinder access to any program or data held in any computer, or to impair the operation of any program or data held in any computer. this law is also punishable by up to 10 years in prison in the UK.
